# MoviesX

This is my fork of [Xamarin Forms Movies](https://github.com/davidortinau/xamarin-forms-movies) project.

## Description

**Movies** is a Xamarin.Forms application that makes use of The Movie Database (TMDb) API, 
a popular, user editable database for movies and TV shows, to demonstrate the possibilities 
of the new backend making use of a great variety of functionality.
